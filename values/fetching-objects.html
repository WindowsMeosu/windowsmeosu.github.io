		<p>Objects for my upcoming project are identified by a serial, for example 
A userpage could be 9, Z is the object name so it can identify the serial and call it. Or Y could be the homepage, and 14 could be the serial. Multiple ways this could work. 
Let's use our userpage example; 
int Z = 9 calls the remains of a userpage. 
if the numbered ID is 9, the lettered ID is Z (this is randomly given to objects so it can easily be fetched, this is not in any order whatsoever) however; if a object doesn't exist, it is given the "undefinedobj" variable. This is shown in the second example.</p>

<p>However, this just checks if a object exists or not. It doesn't check any databases or fetch anything from the API thus making this unreliable if your using it to check anything that isn't checking if a object exists.</p>
