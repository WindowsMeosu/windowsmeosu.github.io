   How do I post a blog?
  
 
  1. well first you need to go to here: [githublink](https://github.com/WindowsMeosu/windowsmeosu.github.io/tree/master)

  2.  Find the peppyblog/blogs directory
 
  3.  Click on 'Create a new file' and end the title with ".md" (not .html)
 
   4.  I think you can finish the rest from there...
